Embrace the gravitational pull of the rabbit hole, I say. We need to stop complaining about how people toy with the thing instead of using it. Photographers compare film vs digital, cyclists look for the bike that completes their collection (N+1), cinephiles spot the mise-en-sc√®ne, and people with 3D printers spend too much time in the garage. That's fine! Let the hobby be the hobby.

The point of a hobby is to enjoy how you spend time. If that's not happening _then_ find something else to do. But usually hobbies are fun because they let you obsess deeply (even if for a short time) about some oddity and that's all that matters.

When I was in middle school, one of my teachers introduced the class to Macromedia [Dreamweaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia#Dreamweaver) (we got to use the colorful iMac G3). I loved the heck out of that tool and followed a little built-in tutorial and taught myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Did I build anything useful? Only a short script that looped alert dialogs infinitely such that the only way to clear them was to shut down the Mac. Did I get in trouble for "hacking and potentially destroying school equipment" for it? Maybe yeah! But it sparked an interest that turned into an obsession and eventually a career.

Passion drives outcomes.

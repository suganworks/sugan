_Artifex Typographicus._ Once touted for their ability to chisel a curvy serif and hand-set a rack of cases, later chained to Mac with a manually calibrated display fiddling with ligatures, only to be commoditized into near oblivion. Type foundries shutter regularly. Fonts are rarely "produced"; that concept will disappear as fonts are generated out of thin prompt.

The same will happen to various specialists, engineers, tool makers, artists, and tradesfolk. An entire score of digital crafts will whittle away and become a lost art.

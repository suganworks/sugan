There’s an ancient meme depicting the steps required to draw an owl. It begins with, “1. draw two circles” for the head and body. The second step is a detailed, fully completed sketch of a majestic owl with the caption, “2. draw the rest of the fucking owl”. We marvel at an artist’s ability to wrangle inspiration into reality. When we connect with what they’ve created, it finds a place in our heart.

Technology does more than create a boundless canvas; it unlocks forms of expression never before capable. It gives agency to those with inventiveness and passion. It lowers the barrier to entry for everyone. Advancements like AI are launching humanity into a new age. It’s up to us to seize this opportunity; to lay down new abstractions that future generations can build upon and thrive.
